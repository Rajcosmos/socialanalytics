### Hi, this is a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity for 5 News Media - BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox and New York times
### We are charting 2 plots - scatter using matplotlib and Bar graph using Seaborn libraries
###  Observation, 
### Ran the script 3 days consecutive just to collect samples and understand the variance in the sentiments of the 5 different media news
### 1. By looking at scatter plot (relation between tweets polarity and tweets ago), the tweet polarity is ranging from neutral (0) to -ve sentiments for most of the nytimes and foxnews. Only BBC,CBS and CNN were ranging between +ve and neutral
#### Continue #1-> conclusion, nytimes and Foxnews focus on somewhat -ve news.
####2. By looking at bar chart, CBS has overall highest positive tweets. 
### 3. Also plotted -ve average sentiments to check on which media is most overall sentiment -ve, mostly Fox and NY times were slightly have slighlt less +ve sentiments comparitive to other 3 media sources.
